# Password Generator

This is a site for generating random passwords at a 10 character length.  There are four degrees of security:

* 1 --- only lower case
* 2 --- lower and upper case
* 3 --- lower, upper and numbers
* 4 --- lower, upper, numbers and special characters

## Usage

A button will prompt you to generate a password.  Upon pushing it, you will recieve a popup asking if you want to have a 1 through 4 security level (as described in the previous section).  After selecting a level, a passwork will be generated in the box on the page.
